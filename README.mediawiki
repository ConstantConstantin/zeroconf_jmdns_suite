= Zero-Configuration =

This repository is populated by RoS packages for handling zero-configuration across 
platforms. The implementations are convenient wrappers around platform-dependant 
implementations whose purpose are both to expose a fairly standard sort of api as
well as a ros api (topics and services) where practical.

== Platform Implementations ==

 * Avahi : c++ and python implementations for linux.
 * Jmdns : a java (generic) and a customised implementation for android.
 * Bonjour : implementations for windows and apple.

== Status ==

Currently awaiting an official code review by interested members of the RoS community.

== Roadmap ==

This is only a rough plan at the moment. In particular the network discovery tools needs
some though on how to design and implement such a feature.

 * Avahi implementations
 * Jmdns and android implementations
 * Bonjour implementations
 * Discovery tools for network connectivity
 * Utilities
