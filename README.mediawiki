= Zero-Configuration =

This repository is populated by RoS packages for handling zero-configuration across 
platforms. The implementations are convenient wrappers around platform-dependant 
implementations whose purpose are both to expose a fairly standard sort of api as
well as a ros api (topics and services) where practical.

=== Platform Implementations ===

* Avahi : c++ and python implementations for linux.
* Jmdns : a java (generic) and a customised implementation for android.
* Bonjour : implementations for windows and apple.

Note that the android code can be found in the separate zeroconf_android stack.

=== Status ===

* zeroconf_avahi : done
* jmdns : running, but rough around the edges.
* zeroconf_avahi_python : ...
* zeroconf_avahi_embedded : ...

=== Roadmap ===

This is only a rough plan at the moment. In particular the network discovery tools needs
some though on how to design and implement such a feature.

* Avahi implementations
* Jmdns and android implementations
* Bonjour implementations
* Discovery tools for network connectivity
* Utilities
