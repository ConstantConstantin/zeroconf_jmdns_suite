Need to cleanup and drag across from our yujin repo.

Is there an easy way to share java libraries with android runnable packages? I can do
from jar file right now, but its terribly awkward, so its almost worth having a separate
android jmdns library package + pure java jmdns library package.

Probably worth waiting till android.rosjava settles down and our code api review is fixed.
